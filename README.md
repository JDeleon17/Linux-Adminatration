This is a repository for my Linux Administration Class


Hello Everyone my name is Jason De Leon.
I currently work as an Technicain Support for a company called Lithion Battery and my office is located in Billerica.
With two other employees we manage and support a total of 11 office. Most are located in the states and some accross the world. Norway, China, Canada, UK and more.


We have over 12 Physical Server (not including NAS) with at least 6 being located in my branch.
I provide support for systems like Xerox DocuShare, AS400, Bartender, SolidWorks, M1 and alot more servies/programs.
It's a constatnly learning field with new issues at every turn. It's never a dull day so get your mug of coffee ready. It will be a busy job.
